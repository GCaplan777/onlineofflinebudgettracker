# Online Offline Budget Tracker

## Description

Dropped internet service is an everyday experience. Here, we design an app where functionality is A+ with or without a connection. Our budget tracker utilizes tech such as Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose and Compression to access the local browers data cache. Our user can add expenses and deposits to their budget on or offline. If offline, those totals will be still populate the total when back and in good service.
